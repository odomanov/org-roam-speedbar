* org-roam-speedbar

** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-roam-speedbar)
#+end_src

Before you use ~org-roam-speedbar~ you need to customize or set up the id
for the starting node.  For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-sb-startid "1cfc93fd-d5d1-4031-9c71-785216bb9f32")
#+end_src

After that launch ~speedbar~.  In Files and Buffers display modes the
command ~o~ switches to the Org-Roam display mode. It shows the
~org-roam-sb-startid~ with one level expanded.
